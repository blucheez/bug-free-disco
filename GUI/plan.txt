The plan of the GUI will be to allow a pretty looking GUI for any kind of
data analysis that we want to do with python.

Essentially, we want to make a distributable, pretty looking version of the
command prompt that can be widely adapted to a wide variety of data inputs and
outputs

There will be an html file, served as a front and static front end for the user
to use. There will also be a single javascript file that handles the
interactions between the GUI and the server side logic.
In addition to these files, there will be a javascript file that will contain
the various types of input and output. This will use React to run.

The client will know what program it wants to run, and request data from the
server
In return, the server will tell the client what data it wants, and the type
of data it will output
The input types are as follows:
Strings
Doubles
Binary Files

The output types are as follows:
Strings
Doubles

I give up on trying to use Flask. It's just not a good framework for using a static site, and documentation is pretty weird (the URL_for method which is widely touted about has very few examples). Coupled with the fact that the documentation itself warns not to use it for a web server, my time would be better utilized on a more serious web development platform.

Of course, why don't I just want to use NodeJS? I want access to the python libraries, of course! NodeJS is wonderfully easy to do, but I've already done that with the Podcast Engine app and the SketchArea app, of course.
